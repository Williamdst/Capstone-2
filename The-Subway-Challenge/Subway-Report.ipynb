    "The Subway Challenge is a challenge in which participants must navigate the entire New York City Subway system in the shortest time possible. This ride is also known as the Rapid Transit Challenge and the Ultimate Ride. Although the challenge requires competitors to stop at all 472 stations, no person currently holds that record <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_Challenge#Guinness_Record_times\"> [] </a>. The most recent record of 21H:28M:14S was set on July 22, 2016 by Matthew Ahn for the 469-Station Challenge <a href=\"https://www.timeout.com/newyork/blog/solo-straphanger-sets-new-all-station-subway-world-record-090616\"> []</a>. Other than beginning at the Rockaway Park-Beach 116th Street Station and ending at Flushing-Main Street nobody knows the method he used to beat the record. The subway system can be modeled as a graph where the stations are the nodes, connected by the train tracks which are the edges. <br></br>\n",

    "To solve this problem a graph representation of the subway system needs to be constructed. The subway system can be modeled as a weighted undirected graph, where the weights on the edges are the time it takes to get from one station to the next. Since you can travel in both directions on each line the direction is not needed <i>(there is one station that is an exception)</i>. The actual map of the system needs to be translated into nodes and edges; to simplify this translation the <a href=\"https://new.mta.info/map/5336\">Late Night Subway Service</a> map is used. In the late night subway map all stations are served though not all lines run; most lines run local, making all stops. The late night map is a starting point to attempt beating the challenge. The map cannot be used, as is, to beat the challenge because the map is only valid from 00:00 - 06:00 everyday. The late night map tells you <b>what</b> to do, but not <b>how</b> to do it. <br></br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once 6:00 hits all trains are activated and express routes are implemented. For example, the late night A-train might go to certain stops, but it skips over them in the day. In the day you wouldn't be able to sit on the A-train the entire time to get to every stop, you would have to get off and make a transfer to the C-train to get to all the local stops. On that note this is why the goal is to determine a set of paths and not just a single path. The only weight the algorithm understands is the time between stations, it doesn't understand that train switching is expensive. Everytime you get off a train you have to wait for the next one to arrive which adds to the overall time. Therefore, the algorithm can only return a set of potential options that a human would need to then filter through."

    "Like any route-inspection style problem this problem is about decision making, specifically what are you going to do at junctions (nodes with degree greater than 2). Let's look at the simple network below to understand the idea. The challenge is to stop at every station and you plan on starting at A. You can basically ignore station B and C because to get from A to D you don't have a choice but to stop at those stations. It's when you get to station D a choice has to be made. Do you go to F first, come back to D, and then go to E or do you go to E first come back and go to F. Taking the ABC<b>DFD</b>E route will cost you 28 compared to the 20 it will cost you taking the ABC<b>DED</b>F. What makes the Subway Challenge so tricky is that taking the optimal DED route requires you to get off the blue train you were already on and wait for the red train and then again on the way back for the blue train. Whereas the less optimal route requires you to get off the blue train for the red train once. If the wait time at D for a train is over 8 then the suboptimal DFD route becomes the optimal route. \n",

    "Let's resist the idea of ignoring stations B and C begin. As stated previously, at those stations you have no choices and on your way to D you will pass them anyway. If that is the case, then you can reduce the network by removing them (<i>Figure 2</i>) and change the how you the challenge is viewed. The nodes in the network are all the stations, the nodes are only the stations where you have to make a decision. Or in other words, the stations that allow you to transfer to a different train. With that, what you are trying to do is travel every edge <b>at least once</b>. By doing that you will automatically stop at every station. This modification officially turns our problem into a <b>Chinese Postman Problem</b> (CPP). In simplest terms, the Chinese postman problem aims is to find a path that visits every edge of a graph. \n",

    "In 2017 Andrew Brooks was tackling a similar problem and he solved it using the NetworkX 2.0 library <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/networkx-python-graph-tutorial\"> []</a> . Thankfully, he packaged his solution into the <a href=\"https://github.com/brooksandrew/postman_problems\">postman_problems</a> package. With this package you can plug in your own network and solve the CPP problem. Unfortunately, the Subway Challenge isn't a typical CPP problem. The postman always wants to return to his vehicle, so the CPP finds a path that always returns to the starting point. The Subway Challenge has no such requirement, the sole requirement is to travel to all the edges at least once. Andrew's postman_package finds solves the CPP as is, therefore plugging in the subway network wouldn't work because it would return us to where we started which is a suboptimal solution. However, Andrew did do all of the heavy lifting and with a little bit of network theory, the NetworkX 2.5 update, and some tweaks to his package, we could build on his work to solve the problem. "

    "In graph theory a path is a sequence of vertices with the property that each vertex in the sequence is adjacent to the vertex next to it. A circuit is a path that begins and ends at the same vertex. If we think of it in terms of racing, a path is a street race. You don't necessarily end up at the same point where you started (although you could) but all the streets are connected to each other. A circuit is a nascar race where you always end where you start. An Euler circuit not only has to meet the conditions of a regular circuit (starting and ending at the same place) it has the added conditions that you have to use <b>every</b> edge of the graph AND you can only use each edge <b>once</b>.

    "Andrew's solution solves for the Euler circuit which isn't what we are looking for, we are looking for an Euler Path. An Euler Path is a path that has the added conditions that you have to use <b>every</b> edge of the graph <b>exactly once</b>.

In an Euler Path these dead-ends serve as the starting and ending nodes. In Andrew's problem he turned all the odd-degree nodes even, in our problem we have to turn all but two of those nodes even. Therefore, all we had to do was find the set of odd nodes, remove two of them, and then follow Andrew's steps. Those two conserved nodes will be the starting point and the ending point. The question then became, which two odd-degree nodes do we conserve. Choosing where to start and where to end is part of the difficulty of the Subway Challenge.\n",

For every configuration we will remove those two odd-degree nodes and then follow the same steps to come up with the path/s that require the least amount of effort to doubleback. "
