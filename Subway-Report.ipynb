    "The Subway Challenge is a challenge in which participants must navigate the entire New York City Subway system in the shortest time possible. This ride is also known as the Rapid Transit Challenge and the Ultimate Ride. Although the challenge requires competitors to stop at all 472 stations, no person currently holds that record <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_Challenge#Guinness_Record_times\"> [1] </a>. The most recent record of 21H:28M:14S was set on July 22, 2016 by Matthew Ahn for the 469-Station Challenge <a href=\"https://www.timeout.com/newyork/blog/solo-straphanger-sets-new-all-station-subway-world-record-090616\"> [2]</a>. Other than beginning at the Far Rockawy-Mott Avenue and ending at Flushing-Main Street nobody knows the method he used to beat the record. The subway system can be modeled as a graph where the stations are the nodes, connected by the train tracks which are the edges. <br></br>\n",

    "To solve this problem a graph representation of the subway system needs to be constructed. The subway system can be modeled as a weighted undirected graph, where the weights on the edges are the time it takes to get from one station to the next. Since you can travel in both directions on each line the direction is not needed <i>(there is one station that is an exception)</i>. The actual map of the system needs to be translated into nodes and edges; to simplify this translation the <a href=\"https://new.mta.info/map/5336\">Late Night Subway Service</a> map is used. In the late night subway map all stations are served though not all lines run; most lines run local, making all stops. The late night map is a starting point to attempt beating the challenge. The map cannot be used, as is, to beat the challenge because the map is only valid from 00:00 - 06:00 everyday. The late night map tells you <b>what</b> to do, but not <b>how</b> to do it. <br></br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once 6:00 hits all trains are activated and express routes are implemented. For example, the late night A-train might go to certain stops, but it skips over them in the day. In the day you wouldn't be able to sit on the A-train the entire time to get to every stop, you would have to get off and make a transfer to the C-train to get to all the local stops. On that note this is why the goal is to determine a set of paths and not just a single path. The only weight the algorithm understands is the time between stations, it doesn't understand that train switching is expensive. Everytime you get off a train you have to wait for the next one to arrive which adds to the overall time. Therefore, the algorithm can only return a set of potential options that a human would need to then filter through."

    "Like any route-inspection style problem this problem is about decision making, specifically what are you going to do at junctions (nodes with degree greater than 2). Let's look at the simple network below to understand the idea. The challenge is to stop at every station and you plan on starting at A. You can basically ignore station B and C because to get from A to D you don't have a choice but to stop at those stations. It's when you get to station D a choice has to be made. Do you go to F first, come back to D, and then go to E or do you go to E first come back and go to F. Taking the ABC<b>DFD</b>E route will cost you 28 compared to the 20 it will cost you taking the ABC<b>DED</b>F. What makes the Subway Challenge so tricky is that taking the optimal DED route requires you to get off the blue train you were already on and wait for the red train and then again on the way back for the blue train. Whereas the less optimal route requires you to get off the blue train for the red train once. If the wait time at D for a train is over 8 then the suboptimal DFD route becomes the optimal route. \n",

If that is the case, then you can reduce the network by removing them (<i>Figure 2</i>) and change the how you the challenge is viewed. The nodes in the network are all the stations, the nodes are only the stations where you have to make a decision. Or in other words, the stations that allow you to transfer to a different train. With that, what you are trying to do is travel every edge <b>at least once</b>. By doing that you will automatically stop at every station.

    "In 2017 Andrew Brooks was tackling a similar problem and he solved it using the NetworkX 2.0 library <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/networkx-python-graph-tutorial\"> []</a> . Thankfully, he packaged his solution into the <a href=\"https://github.com/brooksandrew/postman_problems\">postman_problems</a> package. With this package you can plug in your own network and solve the CPP problem. Unfortunately, the Subway Challenge isn't a typical CPP problem. The postman always wants to return to his vehicle, so the CPP finds a path that always returns to the starting point. The Subway Challenge has no such requirement, the sole requirement is to travel to all the edges at least once. Andrew's postman_package finds solves the CPP as is, therefore plugging in the subway network wouldn't work because it would return us to where we started which is a suboptimal solution. However, Andrew did do all of the heavy lifting and with a little bit of network theory, the NetworkX 2.5 update, and some tweaks to his package, we could build on his work to solve the problem. "

Edges are defined by the two nodes that it is connected to so the first thing needed are the Start Station ID and the Stop Station ID. The three other properties were the routes (same idea as the \"lines\" column), the nodes (the node numbers), and the distance. In this case, the distance was the <b>time</b> it takes to traverse an edge, or in other words the time to go from one station to the next. The edge that connects Canal St to W 4 St-Wash Sq was:\n",

For example, you are on the A train and you get off at Fulton St, you can then walk over to Fulton St on the 3 train. I'm sure these subway transfers are extremely useful when solving the challenge, however they can't be used to model the network at this time. Why? The subway transfers are optional, not a requirement like the other edges. If those transfers were added to the graph, then the program will solve the problem under the impression that it must traverse the edge."

    "If you never had to doubleback and could teleport to whatever station you needed to, the time it would take to traverse each of the 104 edges exactly one time would be 14.75 hours (884m). The rest of the time is spent going back over edges you already went over; in Matthew Ahn's case that was nearly 7 hours. The important columns that are used to pick a route are distance_walked and distance_doublebacked. The reason that edges_walked isn't a major concern is because it matters <b>what</b> edge you had to doubleback. You can't make the claim that a route with 150 edges_walked is better than an 151 edge route, because that one edge may be the worst edge in the network.\n",

    "The node that was in 8 of the top 10 routes, either the start or the end, was station 416 Wakefield-241 St (The last stop of the 2 train). What's more interesting is that all of the nodes paired with it were also extreme stations, meaning they were at the end of a line. More than that, extremes were aggressively extreme, not only were they at the end of a line they were at the end of lines that had no transfer oppurtunities and took over 15m to reach. Which is why Matthew's solution makes sense he started and ended at two very aggresive extremes and the path that contained those two extremes took 21.06 hours (37th ranked route)."

Remember that the program doesn't understand the cost of excessive transfers, there are transfers that provide shortcuts, and the network topology isn't static. The one major insight that can be used to filter out routes is that aggresively extreme stations are where you want to start and where you want to end; which leaves about only 10 choices (45 configurations). I won't list out the steps for the best routes because each route has over 145 steps, but there is a <code>Describe-Route.sql</code> file in the \"Scripts\" folder that contains the query that can be used to list out all the steps for any path.
